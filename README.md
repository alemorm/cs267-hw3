I built an useful bash tool for building, running and debugging the UPC++ project. Hopefully it can be of use to anyone working on HW3 as a final project! 

*Note:* it assumes you have placed your HW3 code in the /global/cscratch1/sd/username ($SCRATCH) and that you have saved the datasets (/project/projectdirs/mp309/cs267-spr2020/hw3-datasets) inside your build directory as "my_datasets". Also, don't forget to make it an executable shell file in order to run it (chmod 700). Feel free to reach out on GitHub for any questions.
